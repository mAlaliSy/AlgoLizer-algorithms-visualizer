# AlgoLizer | Algorithms Visualizer
Algolizer is an open source Android app for visualizing algorithms with a nice animation

## Available Algorithms:
#### Shortest path algorithms:
1. A*
2. Dijkstra
3. Greedy best-first
4. Bredth-first search (BFS), on a grid with equal weight edges (BFS is similar to Dijkstra when the weight of edges are equal)

#### Other graph algorithms
##### Graph Traversal Algorithms
1. BFS (Breadth First Search)
2. DFS (Depth First Search)

##### Minimum Cost Spanning Tree(MST) Algorithms 
1. Kruskal's Algorithm
2. Prim's Algorithm
#### Sorting algorithms (coming soon)
