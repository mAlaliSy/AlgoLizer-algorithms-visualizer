# AlgoLizer | Algorithms Visualizer
Algolizer is an open source Android app for visualizing algorithms with a nice animation

## Available Algorithms:
#### Shortest path algorithms:
1. A*
2. Dijkstra
3. Greedy best-first
4. Bredth-first search (BFS), on a grid with equal weight edges (BFS is similar to Dijkstra when the weight of edges are equal)

#### Other graph algorithms (coming soone)
#### Sorting algorithms (coming soone)
